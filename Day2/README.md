# Whole Genome Sequencing Workshop - Day 2
Welcome to Day 2 of the MARC Whole Genome Sequencing Workshop. Today's focus will be on pipeline preprocessing, quality control, alignment, and Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR).

## Overview
Day 2 dives into the critical steps of WGS data processing, including quality checking, alignment, and post-alignment processing.

## Objectives
* Understand and execute quality control checks on sequencing data.
* Learn and perform sequence alignment using BWA.
* Understand and apply the concepts of BQSR.
## Schedule
* Introduction to WGS Pipeline
* Quality Control and Preprocessing
* Hands-On Exercise on QC
* Sequence Alignment
* Hands-On Alignment Exercise
* Introduction to BQSR
* BQSR Exercise
* Discussion and Q&A
## Preparation
* Review the basics of sequencing data and its common formats.
* Familiarize yourself with the concepts of sequence alignment.
