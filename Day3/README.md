# Whole Genome Sequencing Workshop - Day 3
Welcome to Day 3, the concluding day of the MARC Whole Genome Sequencing Workshop. Today's sessions will cover variant calling, understanding VCF files, and variant filtering techniques.

## Overview
The final day focuses on the identification of genomic variants from sequencing data and the interpretation of variant calling format (VCF) files.

## Objectives
* Perform variant calling using GATK.
* Understand the structure and information within VCF files.
* Learn techniques for filtering and interpreting variants.
## Schedule
* Introduction to Variant Calling
* Hands-On Variant Calling Exercise
* Understanding VCF Files
* Variant Filtering Techniques
* Practical Filtering Exercise
* Wrap-Up and Final Q&A
## Preparation
* Brush up on genomic variants and their significance in WGS.
* Read about the basics of VCF files.
## Resources
* [GATK Variant Calling Guide](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-)
* [VCF File Format Reference](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf)
## Exercises
The day includes practical exercises in variant calling and filtering, providing hands-on experience in these critical analysis steps.
